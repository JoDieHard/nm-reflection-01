# nm-reflection-01
This is my first reflection task at Netmatters. 

The project will demonstrate my learning progress so far.
It will be useful to find holes in my knowledge and improve my overall workflow
Feel free to inspect my project and learn from what I have created. 
This project will be maintained by JoDieHard, once completed. Potentially adding more features in the future.
